# PCA and Clustering Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques such as **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** for unsupervised learning. The goal is to explore the structure of the data, reduce its dimensionality, and analyze clustering performance using evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview
This project applies PCA and clustering techniques to a dataset. It focuses on:
1. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**:
   - Visualizing data in a reduced feature space (2D) while retaining as much variance as possible.
2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Exploring different numbers of clusters (`K`) and evaluating clustering quality using metrics such as Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).
3. **Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - Investigating various configurations of hierarchical clustering, including the number of clusters, distance metrics, and linkage methods.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Using ARI to assess how well clustering matches the true labels.
